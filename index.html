        <h3>golden celebration</h3>
        <p>
          One of the largest-flowered English Roses, bearing rich yellow blooms
          in the form of giant cups. They have a strong Tea fragrance,
          developing wonderfully combined notes of Sauternes wine and
          strawberry. The flowers held beautifully poised on long, arching
          branches.For best results, grow Rosa ‘Golden Celebration’ in moist but
          well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. Prepare the soil well
          and mulch yearly with well-rotted manure or garden compost. Deadhead
          spent blooms to prolong flowering.

          This rose is a cross between a Floribunda and a Hybrid Tea and it
          blooms in clusters. It really is a rose fit for a queen. Very elegant
          and regal. It looks wonderful in any garden bed, but especially under
          a window. This beautiful rose will grow up to 6 feet (and maybe even
          up to 10 feet if you're lucky), and because its width can reach about
          3 feet or much more, it needs plenty of space if you want to show it
          off as a glorious specimen shrub, or you can even train several plants
          to form a hedge. This can be done by keeping the lower branches cut
          back well which encourages most of the flowers to bloom on the upper
          and top parts. It was specially bred in 1954 by the rose breeder
          Lammerts, to mark the Queen's Coronation in 1953 and it was a
          brilliant success. So remarkable that it is still around after 50
          years of world-wide popularity. No wonder, with its regal blooms held
          upright as if it were the Queen wearing her Crown. The whole
          Grandiflora bush looks Royal. This rose was inducted into the Rose
          Hall of Fame in 1979. This makes it reliable, hardy and disease
          resistant.

          A Teasing Georgia planting in full bloom is something wonderful to
          behold. That's because it's a repeat bloomer, and it bears its big
          blooms heavily, lending the planting a sumptuous vision during the
          height of its season. According to David Austin, it's well-suited to
          tall walls or fences and can also be trained to grow up pillars. It
          can thrive in all soil types but grows best in full sun in East-,
          South-, or West-facing areas.Teasing Georgia can be used as a climber
          and will reach 8-10ft. Named for Mr. Ulrich Meyer, after his wife
          Georgia, both of whom are well known media personalities in Germany.
          Winner of the Henry Edland Medal in 2000 for the best scented variety
          in the R.N.R.S. Trials and awards in other trials both in the UK and
          around the world.

          ofhoney and almond blossom, which becomesstronger in warmer weather.
          Winchester Cathedral Rose will grow to be about 4 feet tall at
          maturity, with a spread of 4 feet. It tends to fill out right to the
          ground and therefore doesn't necessarily require facer plants in
          front. It grows at a fast rate, and under ideal conditions can be
          expected to live for approximately 20 years. This shrub should only be
          grown in full sunlight. It does best in average to evenly moist
          conditions, but will not tolerate standing water. It is not particular
          as to soil type or pH. It is highly tolerant of urban pollution and
          will even thrive in inner city environments. This particular variety
          is an interspecific hybrid.
